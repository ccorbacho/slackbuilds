# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

chmlib:
chmlib: CHMLIB is a library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS/CHM format files.
chmlib: Right now, it is a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing
chmlib: with all of the .chm files I've come across. Due to the fairly well-
chmlib: designed indexing built into this particular file format, even a small
chmlib: library is able to gain reasonably good performance indexing into ITSS
chmlib: archives.
