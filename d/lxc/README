LXC is the userspace control package for Linux Containers, a lightweight
virtual system mechanism sometimes described as "chroot on steroids".

LXC builds up from chroot to implement complete virtual systems, adding
resource management and isolation mechanisms to Linuxâ€™s existing process
management infrastructure.

(To use this in conjunction with libvirt, you will need to remount
/sys/fs/cgroup with each cgroup being mounted in a separate subdirectory).
