sparse:
sparse: Sparse, the semantic parser, provides a compiler frontend capable of
sparse: parsing most of ANSI C as well as many GCC extensions, and a
sparse: collection of sample compiler backends, including a static analyzer
sparse: also called "sparse". Sparse provides a set of annotations designed
