psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. It supports the
full Python DBAPI 2.0, and is thread safe at level 2. psycopg was
designed for heavily multi-threaded applications.

This SlackBuilds requires that PostgreSQL is installed to build, and
to be useful. A PostgreSQL SlackBuild is available from SlackBuilds.org.
